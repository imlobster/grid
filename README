    and may contain bugs.


this repository contains of 3 folders:

    grid/
	grid.hh -- a single header you need to read grid
	packed archives.

    packer/
	just a packer that you need to compile yourself.

    explorer/
	ls and cat but for the grid packde archives.


packer and explorer contain their own README file with more
detailed explanations.
