grid -- is an archiver written in C++ focused on random
access.  It is meant for reading from code and writing wtih
a special utility.



        [DISCLAIMER]
    This tool is not tested
    and may contain bugs.



To use it follow this instruction:

    First of all, compile 'grid' utility.

        On Linux, run 'build.sh'.

        On Windows, build it with CMake.

    Then setup your source folder.

        Create new directory.

        Create another directory in the new one.  It will be
        the root for grid.  Your content belongs here.

        Create a file, for clarity, call it '.gridfile'.

        Gridfile must contain only two lines.  First one for
        the root directory, second one for the image
        destination.

        On Linux, you can make a build script for this:

            #!/usr/bin/env sh

            if ! type grid >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                exit 127
            fi

            gridfile=".gridfile"

            out="assets.pak"
            root="root"

            printf "$root\n$out\n" > "$gridfile" || exit
            grid "$gridfile" || exit

    Now, when the image part done, we can move to the
    scripting API.

        In the include directory of this repository, there
        is a file called 'grid.hh'.  This is a header-only
        grid reading library for C++20+.

        Move it in one of your project's include paths to
        install it.

        The usage is simple:

            There is a type named grid::Path.  It has pretty
            much similiar methods to the original
            std::filesystem::path one.  You will use it for
            paths in a grid::Grid.

            There is a simple code that opens an image and
            reades a file content:

                grid::Grid assets("./assets.pak");

                std::vector<char> player_sprite;
                assets.read("/sprites/player.png", player_sprite);

    But looking inside of the 'grid.hh' will give you more info.
