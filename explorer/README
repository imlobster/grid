Use this app to look into grid packed files.


To use it follow this instruction:

    First of all, compile 'grider' utility.

        On Linux, run 'build.sh'.

        On Windows, build it with CMake.

    Then just follow this format:

        grider <grid> ( ls | cat ) "<path>"

    Even empty path should be quoted.

    Path is always absolute from the root.


Commands:

    cat prints file content into stdout.

    ls prints directory content into stdout:

        the path is quoted on top of the output.
        directories are painted blue.
        files are painted green.
